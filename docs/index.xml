      <description>About inference Using neural networks is primarily made of 2 phases: training your model and using it. The later part can also be called inference, forward pass or evaluation.
For most researchers, most of the time is used by training : they have to retrain using different architectures or different parameters. However, if you are using deep learning in production, inference is the most critical step.
For companies like Facebook, inference means applying deep learning to hundreds of millions of images each day [link].</description>

      <description>Jupyter Notebooks are pretty awesome. They allow you to prototype and experiment with ease. But did you know that you can also use them as a backend ?
In this tutorial, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to make a simple api that converts radians to degrees. We should end up with something like this:
$ curl &amp;quot;http://serverIp:8888/convert?angle=180&amp;quot; #{&amp;quot;convertedAngle&amp;quot;: 3.141592653589793}  Installation Assuming that jupyter notebook is already installed, first install the kernel_gateway:</description>
